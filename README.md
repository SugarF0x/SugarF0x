# Alex <Sugar_F0x>

Welcome to my profile page. My name is **Alex** (a.k.a. **Sugar_F0x**),
I am a _21 y.o. self-taught full-stack web-developer_ with just about
over 3 years experience since the day i first googled
_'how to make web sites'_.

Currently, I am a senior student at a state university
unrelated to IT, but most of my free time goes to my personal
web dev projects and my part-time job (also being in web dev).

## My current projects

At the time of writing I am working on the following personal projects
(unrelated to employment):

* [Raider](https://github.com/SugarF0x/raider)
        - An attempt at recreating an old smartphone game **Dungeon Raid**
        using canvas (also learning canvas here, namely - konva.js)

I am currently open for commissions.
Contact me at [sugarfox.dev@gmail.com](mailto:sugarfox.dev@gmail.com).
You can get acquainted with my projects in the [archives](https://archive.sugarfox.ru).

## Commit syntax 

When I commit code, I try to segment commits by type.
Each type is represented by an emoji.
Commit type determination is subjective.
This list is subject to change.
