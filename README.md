# Alex <Sugar_F0x>

Welcome to my profile page. My name is **Alex** (a.k.a. **Sugar_F0x**),
I am a _22 y.o. front-end developer_ dabbling in back-end.

Currently I am a full-time frontend developer, though I do take commissions during free time
apart from working in my own pet-projects.

## My current projects

At the moment I dont have much free time to work on commissions or event my own pet projects.

Nevertheless, feel free to ontact me at [sugarfox.dev@gmail.com](mailto:sugarfox.dev@gmail.com).
You can get acquainted with my projects in the [archives](https://archive.sugarfox.ru), though they
are quire outdated now. My latest repositories are of better display.

## My Stack

My main stack sually consists of Vue with Nuxt & Composition API module (excited for Nuxt 3),
though I do have a year of commertial React experience. Can't say that I really like one more
than the other - both React and Vue have their own cases where they shine brightest.

Apart from frontend I can also do backend with Node, Express and MongoDB.
However, I do usually opt for Strapi as my backend solution.
