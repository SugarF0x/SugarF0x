Welcome to my profile page. My name is **Alex** (a.k.a. **Sugar_F0x**),
I am a _21 y.o. self-taught full-stack web-developer_ with just about
over 3 years experience since the day i first googled
_'how to make web sites'_.

Currently, I am a senior student at a state university
unrelated to IT, but most of my free time goes to my personal
web dev projects and my part-time job (also being in web dev).

        - An automation plugin for browser game SimpleMMO
