# Alex <Sugar_F0x>

Welcome to my profile page. My name is **Alex** (a.k.a. **Sugar_F0x**),
I am a _22 y.o. self-taught full-stack web-developer_ with just about
over 4 years experience since the day i first googled
_'how to make web sites'_.

Currently I am a full-time frontend developer, though I do take commissions during free time
apart from working in my own pet-projects.

## My current projects

I am currently doing several projects and thus am closed for commissions.

Some of said projects are:
* [Raider](https://github.com/SugarF0x/raider)
  - An attempt at recreating an old smartphone game **Dungeon Raid**
  using canvas (also learning canvas here, namely - konva.js)
* A commissioned local community district web hub (extended forum)
* A commissioned themed webpage (extended blog)

Nevertheless, feel free to ontact me at [sugarfox.dev@gmail.com](mailto:sugarfox.dev@gmail.com).
You can get acquainted with my projects in the [archives](https://archive.sugarfox.ru).

## My Stack

My main stack sually consists of Vue with Nuxt & Composition API module (excited for Nuxt 3),
though I do have a year of commertial React experience. Can't say that I really loke one more
than the other - both React and Vue have their own cases where they shine brightest.

Apart from frontend I can also do backend with Node, Express and MongoDB.
However, I do usually opt for Strapi as my backend solution.

## Commit syntax 

When I commit code, I try to segment commits by type.
Each type is represented by an emoji.
Commit type determination is subjective.
This list is subject to change.

* :blue_book: Documentation - General documentation changes, in both .md and JsDoc
* :x: Deletion - Removal or deletion of obsolete, redundant or deprecated code
* :white_check_mark: Feature - A new functional feature for end-user
* :hammer_and_wrench: Fix - A bugfix of any kind
* :corn: Miscellaneous - Uncategorized changes
* :recycle: Refactor - Under the hood code changes - nothing new for end-user
* :milky_way: Release - End of dev cycle
* :art: Style - Style changes, no new functionality
