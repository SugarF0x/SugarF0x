# Alex <Sugar_F0x> Tuzov

Welcome to my profile page. My name is **Alex** (a.k.a. **Sugar_F0x**),
I am a _TypeScript_ developper, specializing in front-end and React Native,
however I am no stranger to node backend.

Currently I am a full-time React Native engineer, though I do take commissions during free time
apart from working in my own pet-projects.

## My current projects

The little free time I get I'm currently spending rewriting my [passion-project](https://github.com/SugarF0x/raider)
into [React Native](https://github.com/SugarF0x/raid-native), both to get a better grasp of technology
and to advance said project since it was always meant to be a mobile-centric experience.

There are other pet-projects I maintain every now and then,
though they are not my main focus.

Feel free to ontact me at [sugarfox.dev@gmail.com](mailto:sugarfox.dev@gmail.com).
You can get acquainted with my projects in the [archives](https://archive.sugarfox.ru), 
though they are quire outdated now. My latest repositories are of better display - 
do give them a look, should you be interested.

## My Stack

My main stack usually consists of TypeScript Vue with Nuxt & Composition API module (Nuxt 3 still needs more time IMHO),
when I need something relatively simple setup fast. For larger projects I would rather opt for React with Next.
In regards of native mobile development, I cant yet say I'm confident enough in my React Native skills to have any
reasonable opinion, but I'm well on my way.
