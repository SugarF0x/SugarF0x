# Alex <Sugar_F0x>

Welcome to my profile page. My name is **Alex** (a.k.a. **Sugar_F0x**),
I am a _TypeScript_ developper, specializing in front-end and React Native,
however I am no stranger to node backend.

Currently I am a full-time React Native engineer, though I do take commissions during free time
apart from working in my own pet-projects.

## My current projects

At the moment I dont have much free time to work on commissions or event my own pet projects.

Nevertheless, feel free to ontact me at [sugarfox.dev@gmail.com](mailto:sugarfox.dev@gmail.com).
You can get acquainted with my projects in the [archives](https://archive.sugarfox.ru), though they
are quire outdated now. My latest repositories are of better display.

## My Stack

My main stack usually consists of TypeScript Vue with Nuxt & Composition API module (Nuxt 3 still needs more time IMHO),
when I need something relatively simple setup fast. For larger projects I would rather opt for React with Next.
In regards of native mobile development, I cant yet say I'm confident enough in my React Native skills to have any
reasonable pooinion, but I'm well on my way.
